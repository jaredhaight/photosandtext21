<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Jared, I live in North Carolina and I take pictures.</p>
<p>
    This site is a little side project of mine that I use to play with web design and technologies. In it's current iteration, I dump photos in a folders organized by gallery, where
    they are then processed and feed into a database. This processing includes generating all of the crops, reading the exif data and pulling and comments/descriptions of the photos.
    From there I'm using a local instance of <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> to generate a static copy of the site and then deploying the site to Amazon's S3 service.
    This process offers a number of benefits: I don't have to edit my photography work flow much, all information that's relevant to the site is stored directly in the photos and
    because all of the site is hosted on a CDN, it's quick and even cheaper than hosting a VPS of my own.
</p>
<p>
    All of the code for the site is hosted <a href="https://github.com/jaredhaight/photosandtext21">here, on Github</a>. There's also a number of other projects I've worked on there.
    I'm entirely self taught when it comes to programming, so my code is probably terribly messy and inefficient. It seems to get the job done though, so that's nice.
</p>
<p>
    I very infrequently write things <a href="https://words.photosandtext.com">here.</a>
